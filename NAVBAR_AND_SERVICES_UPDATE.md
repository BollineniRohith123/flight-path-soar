  - Subtitle: White with 70% opacity
  - Hover: Accent color

- **After Scroll** (White background):
  - Logo text: Foreground color (dark)
  - Subtitle: Muted foreground
  - Hover: Primary color

**Navigation Links**:
- **Before Scroll**:
  - Text: White with 90% opacity
  - Hover: White with white/10% background
  - Active: White with white/10% background

- **After Scroll**:
  - Text: Foreground color (dark)
  - Hover: Primary color with primary/10% background
  - Active: Primary color with primary/10% background

**Mobile Menu Button**:
